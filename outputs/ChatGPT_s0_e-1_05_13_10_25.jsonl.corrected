    "prediction": 200,
    "answer": 200,
    "rationale": "To find John's maximum daily profit, we need to first find his daily revenue function. Since John is a price-taker, his daily revenue function is given by R = P*q, where P is the market price and q is the number of acres John chooses to cut a day. Therefore, John's daily revenue function is R = 20q.\n\nNext, we need to find John's daily cost function. John's total cost function is given by TC = 0.1q^2 + 10q + 50. To find his daily cost function, we need to divide his total cost function by the number of days he works, which we will assume is 1. Therefore, John's daily cost function is C = 0.1q^2 + 10q + 50.\n\nNow, we can find John's daily profit function by subtracting his daily cost function from his daily revenue function. Therefore, John's daily profit function is given by:\n\n\u03c0 = R - C\n\u03c0 = 20q - (0.1q^2 + 10q + 50)\n\u03c0 = -0.1q^2 + 10q - 50\n\nTo find John's maximum daily profit, we need to find the value of q that maximizes his profit function. We can do this by taking the derivative of his profit function with respect to q and setting it equal to zero:\n\nd\u03c0/dq = -0.2q + 10 = 0\nq = 50\n\nTherefore, John's maximum daily profit occurs when he mows 50 acres per day. To find his maximum daily profit, we can substitute q = 50 into his profit function:\n\n\u03c0 = -0.1(50)^2 + 10(50) - 50\n\u03c0 = $200\n\nTherefore, the answer is $200.",

    "rationale": "In a perfectly competitive market, the short-run equilibrium price is determined by the intersection of market demand and market supply. In this case, the market demand is given by Q = -200P + 8,000. To find the market supply, we need to sum up the individual firms' supply curves. Each firm's supply curve is given by its marginal cost curve, which can be obtained by taking the derivative of its short-run total cost function with respect to output (q). \n\nMC(q) = dC(q)/dq = q^2/100 + 0.4q + 4\n\nTo find the industry supply curve, we add up the individual firms' marginal cost curves:\n\nMC_industry(Q) = 100 * MC(q) = Q^2/30000 + 40Q + 400\n\nSetting MC_industry(Q) equal to market demand Q = -200P + 8,000, we get:\n\nQ^2/30000 + 40Q + 400 = -200P + 8,000\n\nSimplifying and rearranging, we get a quadratic equation in Q:\n\nQ^2 + 12000Q - 2,280,000 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we get:\n\nQ = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nwhere a = 1, b = 12000, and c = -2,280,000.

    "rationale": "In the Bertrand model, firms compete on price and assume that their rivals will not change their prices in response. In a Nash equilibrium, neither firm has an incentive to deviate from their chosen price given the price of their competitor. \n\nIn this case, the demand curve is Q = 150 - P for both firms. If one firm sets a price P1, the other firm can capture the entire market by setting a slightly lower price P2 = P1 - \u03b5, where \u03b5 is a small positive number. Therefore, the Nash equilibrium is for both firms to set the same price.\n\nTo find the Nash equilibrium price, we can set up the profit function for each firm. The profit for firm i is given by \u03c0i = (P - MC)Qi, where MC = 0 since there are no costs of production. Using the demand curve, we can express Qi as a function of P: Qi = 150 - P.

The columns of A corresponding to the pivot columns of [A | 0] form a basis for S. In this case, we get [I | B] = [1 0 | 1 1; 0 1 | 1 -1], so the basis for S is {[2, 2, 1, 0], [-2, 2, 0, 1]}.\n\n2. Find the projection of 9e_1 onto each basis vector of S. Let's call these projections proj_v1(9e_1) and proj_v2(9e_1), where v1 and v2 are the basis vectors of S.

We can represent each labelled forest as a Pr\u00fcfer sequence of length 5, where the i-th entry in the sequence represents the component containing vertex i+5.\n\nTo count the number of valid Pr\u00fcfer sequences, we can use the following formula:\n\n(number of valid Pr\u00fcfer sequences) = n^(k-2) * (k-2)! * (n-k+1)^5\n\nwhere n is the total number of vertices (in this case, n=10), k is the number of connected components (k=5), and the factor of (n-k+1)^5 accounts for the assignment of the remaining vertices to the components.\n\nTherefore, the number of labelled forests on 10 vertices with 5 connected components, such that vertices 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 all belong to different connected components, is:\n\n10^(5-2) * (5-2)! * (10-5+1)^5 = 10^3 * 6 * 6^5 = 186624000\n\nTherefore, the answer is 186624000.",

For each Pr\u00fcfer sequence, we can construct a corresponding labelled forest as follows: \n\n1. Start with 8 isolated vertices. \n2. Find the smallest label in the Pr\u00fcfer sequence, say A. \n3. Find the vertex with the smallest label that is not in the connected component labelled A, say vertex v. \n4.

    "prediction": 495,
    "answer": 6,
    "rationale": "We can use Burnside's Lemma to solve this problem. The number of distinct necklaces is equal to the average number of necklaces fixed by each element of the symmetry group. The symmetry group of a necklace with 12 beads is the dihedral group D12, which has 24 elements.\n\nFirst, consider the identity element. There are (10+2) choose 2 = 66 ways to place the two B beads among the 12 beads. Therefore, there are 66 distinct necklaces fixed by the identity element.\n\nNext, consider the 11 rotations. Each rotation is determined by the number of beads that are moved from their original position. There are 11 possible numbers of moved beads: 1, 2, ..., 11. If a rotation moves k beads, then the remaining 12-k beads must be in the same relative order as in the original necklace. There are (10 choose k)(2 choose 0) = (10 choose k) ways to choose the k beads that are moved. Therefore, the number of necklaces fixed by a rotation of k beads is (10 choose k).\n\nFinally, consider the 12 reflections. Each reflection is determined by the axis of symmetry, which can be either a line passing through two opposite beads or a line passing through the midpoint of two opposite edges. If a reflection is along a line passing through two opposite beads, then the two B beads must be on opposite sides of the line. There are 5 such lines, and for each line there are (10 choose 1)(2 choose 1) = 20 ways to place the two B beads. Therefore, the number of necklaces fixed by a reflection along such a line is 20. If a reflection is along a line passing through the midpoint of two opposite edges, then the two B beads must be on the same side of the line. There are 6 such lines, and for each line there are (10 choose 2) = 45 ways to place the two B beads. Therefore, the number of necklaces fixed by a reflection along such a line is 45.\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct necklaces is (1/24)(66 + 11(10 + 45 + 120 + 210 + 252 + 210 + 120 + 45 + 10 + 1) + 12(20 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 45)) = 495. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 495.",

We need to distribute 13 identical balls into 4 distinct boxes, which means we need to place 3 dividers (bars) among the 13 balls to separate them into 4 groups.

However, we need to subtract the cases where one or more boxes are empty.

For the third vertex, we have 2 choices again, since we cannot use the same color as the second vertex or the first vertex. However, for the fourth vertex, we have 3 choices, since we can use any of the 3 colors (including the color used for the first vertex). Similarly, we have 3 choices for the color of the fifth vertex.

For the first case, there are 3 choices for the color to use, and for the second case, there are 3 choices for the color of the first pair, and 2 choices for the color of the second pair.

Each intermediate node will introduce a delay of 2 * RTT = 60 ms (since the segment size is 15 Kbytes and the transmission rate is 10 Mbps, it takes 12 ms to transmit each segment). Therefore, the effective bandwidth is:\n\nEffective bandwidth = Segment size / (RTT + Store-and-forward delay)\n                   = 15 Kbytes / (30 ms + 60 ms + 60 ms)\n                   = 100 Kbps\n\nNext, we need to calculate the congestion window (cwnd) at the start of the transmission. Since the initial slow-start threshold is 8 and the segment size is 15 Kbytes, the initial cwnd is:\n\ncwnd = Initial slow-start threshold * Segment size\n     = 8 * 15 Kbytes\n     = 120 Kbytes\n\nSince the client's buffer has a storage space of 150 Kbytes, the maximum cwnd that can be achieved without causing buffer overflow is 150 Kbytes. Therefore, the congestion window will increase from 120 Kbytes to 150 Kbytes during the slow-start phase.\n\nAfter the slow-start phase, the congestion window will increase according to the congestion avoidance algorithm of TCP Reno. Since there is no loss during transmission, the congestion window will increase linearly by 1 segment per RTT. Therefore, the time taken to transmit the whole file can be calculated as follows:\n\nTime taken = (File size + Slow-start phase + Congestion avoidance phase) / Effective bandwidth\n\nwhere File size = 900 Kbytes, Slow-start phase = 2 * RTT, and Congestion avoidance phase = (File size - Slow-start phase) / cwnd * RTT.\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\nTime taken = (900 Kbytes + 2 * 30 ms + (900 Kbytes - 2 * 30 ms) / 120 Kbytes * 30 ms) / 100 Kbps\n           = 9.6 s\n\nTherefore, the answer is 9600 ms.",

Therefore, the probability that no one of them lies inside the triangle formed by the other three is 1 minus the product of these probabilities, which is approximately 0.088.

Since the plank is level, \u03b8 = 0, so sin\u03b8 = 0 and this torque is zero.\n\nTorque due to Cousin Throckmorton's weight = (1/2)L(Mt)g sin\u03b8, where Mt is Throckmorton's mass.

However, the temperature in the room is given as 20\u00b0C, which is not at STP. To find the density of air at 20\u00b0C, we can use the ideal gas law:\n\n$PV = nRT$\n\nwhere P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin. Solving for n/V, we get:\n\n$n/V = P/RT$\n\nAt 20\u00b0C, the pressure of air is approximately 101.3 kPa and the gas constant R is 8.31 J/(mol K). Converting the temperature to Kelvin, we get:\n\n$T = 20\u00b0C + 273.15 = 293.15 \\ K$\n\nSubstituting these values, we get:\n\n$n/V = (101.3 \\ kPa)/(8.31 \\ J/(mol \\ K) \\times 293.15 \\ K) = 0.0409 \\ mol/m^3$\n\nThe molar mass of air is approximately 28.97 g/mol.

We can use the flow rate equation to find the cross-sectional area A1:\n\nA1 = Q/v1 = (\u03c0/4)d1^2v1\n\nSubstituting this into the equation of continuity and simplifying, we get:\n\nv2 = (d1/d2)^2v1\n\nWe don't know the value of d1, but we can use the fact that the pipe is cylindrical to relate it to the diameter of the second section:\n\nd1/d2 = \u221a(A2/A1) = \u221a(0.0012566/((\u03c0/4)d1^2))\n\nSolving for d1, we get:\n\nd1 = \u221a(4A2/\u03c0) = 0.0800 m\n\nTherefore, the diameter of the first section of the pipe is 8.00 cm.\n\nNow we can use the equation for v2:\n\nv2 = (d1/d2)^2v1 = (0.0800/0.0400)^2v1 = 4v1\n\nSubstituting the given flow rate, we get:\n\nv2 = 4Q/A2 = 4(0.0095)/(0.0012566) = 30.1 m/s\n\nTherefore, the flow speed in the second section of the pipe is 30.1 m/s.",

    "rationale": "We can start by drawing a free body diagram of the ladder. There are two forces acting on the ladder: the weight of the ladder acting downwards at its center of mass, and the contact force acting upwards at the base of the ladder. \n\nSince the ladder is in equilibrium, the net force acting on it must be zero. Therefore, the magnitude of the contact force on the base of the ladder must be equal and opposite to the weight of the ladder. \n\nTo find the weight of the ladder, we can use its mass and the acceleration due to gravity. The ladder weighs 180 N, so its mass is:\n\nmass = weight / acceleration due to gravity = 180 N / 9.81 m/s^2 = 18.34 kg\n\nTo find the angle that the ladder makes with the horizontal, we can use the tangent function:\n\ntan(theta) = opposite / adjacent = 5.0 m / h\n\nwhere h is the height of the ladder on the castle wall.

    "rationale": "We can solve this problem using the principle of conservation of angular momentum. Initially, the door is at rest, so its initial angular momentum is zero. After the bullet embeds itself in the door, the system (door + bullet) will start rotating about the vertical axis through its hinges. Let the final angular speed of the system be \u03c9.\n\nThe angular momentum of the system is given by L = I\u03c9, where I is the moment of inertia of the system. Since the bullet embeds itself in the center of the door, we can assume that the moment of inertia of the system remains the same after the collision. Therefore, we can write:\n\nm_bullet * v * (d/2) = I * \u03c9\n\nwhere m_bullet is the mass of the bullet, v is its speed, d is the width of the door, and I is the moment of inertia of the system.\n\nThe moment of inertia of a thin rod rotating about an axis passing through its center is given by I = (1/12) * m * L^2, where m is the mass of the rod and L is its length. In this case, we can assume that the door can be approximated as a thin rod of length d and mass M = 15 kg. Therefore, we have:\n\nI = (1/12) * M * d^2\n\nSubstituting this into the equation above and solving for \u03c9, we get:\n\n\u03c9 = (m_bullet * v * d) / (2 * I)\n    = (0.01 kg * 400 m/s * 1.00 m) / (2 * (1/12) * 15 kg * 1.00 m^2)\n    = 16.0 rad/s\n\nTherefore, the answer is \u03c9 = 16.0 rad/s.",

The sound waves generated by the object pile up in front of it, creating a shock wave that spreads out in a cone behind the object. \n\nThe speed of sound is constant, so we can use the formula distance = speed x time to calculate how long it will take for the sonic boom to reach the ground.

Converting to cm^2 and plugging in the values, we get:\nstress = (40 x 10^4 N/m^2) x (1 m / 100 cm)^2 = 4 x 10^3 N/cm^2\n\nTo find the force exerted on each wall, we need to multiply the stress by the cross-sectional area of the cylinder and the change in length:\nforce = stress x area x \u0394L = (4 x 10^3 N/cm^2) x (20 cm^2) x (0.0012 cm) = 0.096 N\n\nFinally, we need to convert the force to units of 10^4 N:\nforce = 0.096 N x (1 kg m/s^2) / (10^4 N) = 9.6 x 10^-3 kg m/s^2 = 0.096 x 10^4 N\n\nTherefore, the answer is 0.096, which represents the total force exerted on each wall in units of 10^4 N.",

The linear mass density of the rope is given by \u03bc = m/L, where L is the length of the rope.

The number of target nuclei per unit area can be calculated using Avogadro's number and the density of U-238, which is 19.1 g/cm^3. The atomic mass of U-238 is 238 g/mol, so the number of U-238 nuclei per unit volume is (6.022 x 10^23 atoms/mol) x (1 mol/238 g) x (19.1 g/cm^3) = 5.86 x 10^22 nuclei/cm^3. Multiplying this by the thickness of the sample (3.2 cm) gives the number of target nuclei per unit area, which is 1.87 x 10^23 nuclei/cm^2.\n\nSubstituting these values in the formula, we get:\n\nProbability of fission = (0.68 x 10^-24 cm^2) x (1.87 x 10^23 nuclei/cm^2) x (3.2 cm)\n                     = 3.2 x 10^-2\n\nTherefore, the probability of a 2.0-MeV neutron producing fission in a pure U-238 sample of thickness 3.2 cm is 0.032 or 3.2%.",

    "rationale": "We can start by finding the pattern of the exponents. Notice that the exponent of 3 is a tower of 3's, with each level having one more 3 than the previous level. Specifically, the exponents are:\n\n3^3 = 27\n3^(3^3) = 3^27 = 7625597484987 (note that this is a 14-digit number)\n3^(3^(3^3)) = 3^(7625597484987) (this is a huge number)\n\nWe can see that the exponents quickly become too large to compute directly. However, we can still find the remainder when these numbers are divided by 100 by using modular arithmetic.\n\nFirst, notice that 3^4 = 81, which means that any power of 3 greater than 3^3 will have a remainder of 1 when divided by 100. Therefore, we only need to consider the first two exponents:\n\n3^3 = 27, which has a remainder of 27 when divided by 100.\n3^(3^3) = 3^27, which has the same remainder as 3^7 (since 27 is congruent to 3 mod 4). We can compute this remainder by repeatedly squaring 3 and taking the remainder:\n\n3^2 = 9\n3^4 = 81 (which has a remainder of 81 when divided by 100)\n3^8 = 6561 (which has a remainder of 61 when divided by 100)\n3^16 = 3721 (which has a remainder of 21 when divided by 100)\n3^27 = 3^16 * 3^8 * 3^2 * 3 = 21 * 61 * 9 * 3 = 3441 (which has a remainder of 41 when divided by 100)\n\nTherefore, the answer is the remainder when 27^3441 is divided by 100. We can use the fact that 27 is congruent to -1 mod 100 to simplify this calculation:\n\n27^2 = 729 (which has a remainder of 29 when divided by 100)\n27^4 = 29^2 = 841 (which has a remainder of 41 when divided by 100)\n27^8 = 41^2 = 1681 (which has a remainder of 81 when divided by 100)\n27^16 = 81^2 = 6561 (which has a remainder of 61 when divided by 100)\n27^32 = 61^2 = 3721 (which has a remainder of 21 when divided by 100)\n27^64 = 21^2 = 441 (which has a remainder of 41 when divided by 100)\n27^128 = 41^2 = 1681 (which has a remainder of 81 when divided by 100)\n27^256 = 81^2 = 6561 (which has a remainder of 61 when divided by 100)\n27^512 = 61^2 = 3721 (which has a remainder of 21 when divided by 100)\n27^1024 = 21^2 = 441 (which has a remainder of 41 when divided by 100)\n27^2048 = 41^2 = 1681 (which has a remainder of 81 when divided by 100)\n\nTherefore, 27^3441 is congruent to -1 * 29 * 81 * 61 * 41 (mod 100).

We want to find the area of the part of the helicoid that lies in the first octant between the cylinders $x^2+y^2=1$ and $x^2+y^2=4$. \n\nFirst, we need to find the limits of integration for $u$ and $v$.

    "rationale": "Since f is analytic, we can use the Cauchy-Riemann equations to find its derivative. Let f(z) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y), where z = x + iy. Then, we have:\n\nf'(z) = (du/dx + i dv/dx) = 1/z^2 = (1/z^2)(x - iy)\n\nEquating the real and imaginary parts, we get:\n\ndu/dx = x/z^2 and dv/dx = -y/z^2\n\nIntegrating with respect to x, we get:\n\nu(x,y) = (x^2 - y^2)/(2z^2) + C1(y)\n\nv(x,y) = -xy/z^2 + C2(y)\n\nwhere C1 and C2 are arbitrary functions of y.\n\nNow, we have f(f(z)) = z. Substituting f(z) = u + iv, we get:\n\nf(f(z)) = u(u,v) + iv(u,v) = x + iy\n\nEquating the real and imaginary parts, we get:\n\nu(u,v) = x and v(u,v) = y\n\nSubstituting the expressions for u and v in terms of x, y, and z, we get:\n\n(x^2 - y^2)/(2z^2) + C1(-xy/z^2) = x\n\n-xy/z^2 + C2(-xy/z^2) = y\n\nSolving for C1 and C2, we get:\n\nC1(y) = (y^2 - x^2)/(2y)\n\nC2(y) = xy/z^2 - y/2\n\nSubstituting these values in the expressions for u and v, we get:\n\nu(x,y) = (x^2 - y^2)/(2z^2) + (y^2 - x^2)/(2y)\n\nv(x,y) = -xy/z^2 + xy/z^2 - y/2\n\nTherefore, the most general possible expression of f(z) is:\n\nf(z) = [(x^2 - y^2)/(2z^2) + (y^2 - x^2)/(2y)] + i[-y/2]\n\nNow, we need to find f(2). Substituting z = 2 in the expression for f(z), we get:\n\nf(2) = [(2^2 - y^2)/(2(2)^2) + (y^2 - 2^2)/(2y)] + i[-y/2]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nf(2) = (1/4) + (3/2y) - (iy/2)\n\nTherefore, the answer is f(2) = (1/4) + (3/2y) - (iy/2).",

Since the projectile lands in the car, we have:\n\nv_final = 100 m/s\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\n10 kg * 200 m/s = (10 kg + 200 kg) * 100 m/s\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nv_final = 9.09 m/s\n\nNow, using projectile motion equations, we can find the time of flight of the projectile:\n\nv_projectile * sin(\u03b8) = 200 m/s\nv_projectile * cos(\u03b8) * t = d\n\nwhere d is the distance travelled by the projectile before landing in the car.

A line of 5 lavender caterpillars, 5 mauve caterpillars and 2 violet caterpillars is 1 m long in total. 4.  A lavender caterpillar takes 10 s to crawl the length of a violet caterpillar. 5.

From fact 5, we know that a mauve caterpillar crawls twice as fast as a lavender caterpillar. Let's say a lavender caterpillar crawls at a speed of 1 unit per second. Then a mauve caterpillar crawls at a speed of 2 units per second.\n\nNow, we can use the given information to find the number of seconds it would take a mauve caterpillar to crawl around the equator of Pluto. From fact 1, we know that 5 mauve caterpillars are equal in length to 7 violet caterpillars. Therefore, the ratio of the length of a mauve caterpillar to a violet caterpillar is 7/5.\n\nFrom fact 2, we know that 3 lavender caterpillars and 1 mauve caterpillar are equal in length to 8 violet caterpillars. Using the ratio we just found, we can write an equation:\n\n3(10) + 1(x) = 8(5(7/5))\nwhere x is the length of a mauve caterpillar in seconds and we have converted the length of the caterpillars to time using fact 4.\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n30 + x = 56\nx = 26\n\nTherefore, a mauve caterpillar takes 26 seconds to crawl the length of a violet caterpillar.\n\nUsing the ratio we found earlier, we can find the length of a mauve caterpillar:\n1 violet caterpillar = 7/5 mauve caterpillars\n1 violet caterpillar = 26/5 seconds\n1 mauve caterpillar = (5/7)(26/5) seconds\n1 mauve caterpillar = 26/7 seconds\n\nFinally, we can find the number of seconds it would take a mauve caterpillar to crawl around the equator of Pluto:\n7408 km = 7408000 meters\n7408000 / (26/7) = 1799230 seconds\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1799230 seconds.",

Therefore, the ratio of the areas of AFG and EGH is the same as the ratio of the bases FG and GH, which is 2:1.\n\nSo, the area of EGH is 3, which means the area of AFG is 6. Now, we can find the area of triangle ACD by subtracting the areas of triangles AFG and EGH from the area of ABCD. Therefore, the area of triangle ACD is 20 - 6 - 3 = 11.\n\nSince CDH is half of triangle ACD, the area of CDH is 11/2 = 5.5.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 5.5.",

    "rationale": "Let's first find the time difference between events A and B according to an observer at rest in the Earth-Sun frame. Since the distance between Earth and Sun is 8.3 light-minutes, it takes 8.3 minutes for light to travel from one to the other. Therefore, event B occurs 8.3 - 2 = 6.3 minutes after event A.\n\nNow, let's consider an observer moving at u = 0.8c from Earth to Sun. According to special relativity, time dilation occurs for moving observers, which means that time appears to pass slower for them compared to an observer at rest in the Earth-Sun frame. The time dilation factor for this observer can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (u/c)^2)\n\nwhere u is the velocity of the observer and c is the speed of light. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\n\u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.8c/c)^2) = 1.67\n\nThis means that time appears to pass 1.67 times slower for the moving observer compared to an observer at rest in the Earth-Sun frame. Therefore, the time difference between events A and B according to the moving observer is:\n\n\u0394t' = \u03b3 * \u0394t = 1.67 * 6.3 = 10.5 minutes\n\nwhere \u0394t is the time difference between events A and B according to an observer at rest in the Earth-Sun frame.\n\nIf the observer is moving in the opposite direction at u = -0.8c, the time dilation factor would be the same, but the sign of the velocity would change. Therefore, the time difference between events A and B according to this observer would be:\n\n\u0394t' = \u03b3 * \u0394t = 1.67 * 6.3 = 10.5 minutes\n\nTherefore, the answer is the same in both cases, which is 10.5 minutes.",

It is assumed that light incident on a cell exposes the grain if it is there and otherwise results in a blank response. Silver iodide particles that are not illuminated and vacant portions of the film remain blank. We make the following assumptions: We grid the film very finely into cells of area $dA$. It is assumed that there is at most one silver iodide particle per cell and that no silver iodide particle is intersected by the cell boundaries.

Since he made monthly payments, the total number of payments is 20 years * 12 months/year = 240 payments.\n\nNext, we can use the formula for the present value of an annuity to calculate the original loan amount. The formula is:\n\nPV = PMT * (1 - (1 + r)^(-n)) / r\n\nwhere PV is the present value of the loan, PMT is the monthly payment, r is the monthly interest rate (which is 7.8% / 12 = 0.65%), and n is the total number of payments (which is 30 years * 12 months/year = 360 payments).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nPV = $1260 * (1 - (1 + 0.0065)^(-360)) / 0.0065\nPV = $182,141.67\n\nTherefore, the original loan amount was $182,141.67.\n\nTo find the balance of the loan in 2015, we need to calculate how much of the loan was left after 240 payments. We can use the formula for the remaining balance of a loan after t payments:\n\nB = PV * (1 + r)^t - PMT * ((1 + r)^t - 1) / r\n\nwhere B is the remaining balance, PV is the original loan amount, PMT is the monthly payment, r is the monthly interest rate, and t is the number of payments made.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nB = $182,141.67 * (1 + 0.0065)^240 - $1260 * ((1 + 0.0065)^240 - 1) / 0.0065\nB = $41,758.67\n\nTherefore, the balance of the loan Mr. Jackson still owes in 2015 is $41,758.67. \n\nTherefore, the answer is $41,758.67.",

In either case, we move on to the next bet with the remaining money.\n\nLet's assume that we play this strategy for $n$ steps. Since each bet is independent, the probability of winning the first bet is $\\frac{1}{2}$, and the probability of losing is also $\\frac{1}{2}$.
