Let $n \\cdot 2^{n+1}+1 = k^2$ for some integer $k$. Rearranging, we get $n \\cdot 2^{n+1} = (k-1)(k+1)$. Since $k-1$ and $k+1$ are consecutive even integers, one of them must be divisible by $4$. Therefore, we have $n \\cdot 2^{n-1} = \\frac{(k-1)(k+1)}{4}$. Since $\\gcd(k-1,k+1) = 2$, one of $k-1$ and $k+1$ is divisible by $2$ but not $4$. Thus, we have $n = 2^{m-2} \\cdot x$, where $m \\geq 3$ and $x$ is odd. Substituting this into the equation above, we get $2^{m-1} \\cdot x = \\frac{(k-1)(k+1)}{4}$. Since $\\gcd(k-1,k+1) = 2$, we have $\\gcd\\left(\\frac{k-1}{2},\\frac{k+1}{2}\\right) = 1$. Therefore, one of $\\frac{k-1}{2}$ and $\\frac{k+1}{2}$ is divisible by $2$ but not $4$. Thus, we have $2^{m-2} \\cdot x = \\frac{\\frac{k-1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{k+1}{2}}{2}$, which implies that $x$ is odd and $\\frac{k-1}{2}$ and $\\frac{k+1}{2}$ are two consecutive even integers that are not divisible by $4$. Therefore, we have $\\frac{k-1}{2} = 2^{m-3}-1$ and $\\frac{k+1}{2} = 2^{m-3}+1$, which implies that $k = 2^{m-2}+1$. Substituting this into the equation $n \\cdot 2^{n+1}+1 = k^2$, we get $n = \\boxed{3}$. Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{3}$.
