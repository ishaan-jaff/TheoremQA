To solve this problem, we can use the conservation of angular momentum. The angular momentum of a rotating object is given by the formula L = I\u03c9, where L is the angular momentum, I is the moment of inertia, and \u03c9 is the angular speed.\n\nThe moment of inertia of a sphere is given by the formula I = (2/5)MR^2, where M is the mass of the sphere and R is its radius. Since the density of the neutron star is 10^14 times greater than that of the original star, and the volume of a sphere is given by (4/3)\u03c0R^3, we can find the mass of the neutron star as follows:\n\nM_neutron_star = 10^14 * M_original_star * (V_neutron_star / V_original_star) = 10^14 * M_original_star * (16 / (7 * 10^5))^3\n\nNow, we can find the angular momentum of the original star and the neutron star:\n\nL_original_star = I_original_star * \u03c9_original_star\nL_neutron_star = I_neutron_star * \u03c9_neutron_star\n\nSince angular momentum is conserved, L_original_star = L_neutron_star. We can now solve for the angular speed of the neutron star:\n\n\u03c9_neutron_star = (I_original_star * \u03c9_original_star) / I_neutron_star\n\nThe original star's radius is 7 * 10^5 km, which is equal to 7 * 10^8 meters. The neutron star's radius is 16 km, which is equal to 1.6 * 10^4 meters. The original star rotates once in 30 days, so its angular speed is:\n\n\u03c9_original_star = 2\u03c0 / (30 * 24 * 60 * 60) rad/s\n\nNow we can plug in the values and solve for \u03c9_neutron_star:\n\n\u03c9_neutron_star = ((2/5) * M_original_star * (7 * 10^8)^2 * 2\u03c0 / (30 * 24 * 60 * 60)) / ((2/5) * 10^14 * M_original_star * (16 / (7 * 10^5))^3)\n\nThe mass of the original star, M_original_star, cancels out, and we are left with:\n\n\u03c9_neutron_star \u2248 (49 * 10^16 * 2\u03c0 / (30 * 24 * 60 * 60)) / (4.78 * 10^-1)\n\n\u03c9_neutron_star \u2248 4600 rad/s\n\nTherefore, the answer is 4600.
