Let's start by counting the number of days between the 300th day of year N and the 200th day of year N + 1. Since year N has 365 days, the 300th day is October 27 (or October 28 in a leap year), and year N + 1 has 366 days (since it's a leap year), the 200th day is July 19. Therefore, the number of days between these two dates is:\n\n(366 - 300) + 199 = 265\n\nNow, since 265 is divisible by 7, we know that the 300th day of year N and the 200th day of year N + 1 fall on the same day of the week. Specifically, if the 300th day of year N is a Tuesday, then the 200th day of year N + 1 is also a Tuesday.\n\nNext, let's count the number of days between the 200th day of year N + 1 and the 100th day of year N - 1. Since year N + 1 has 366 days, the 200th day is July 19, and year N - 1 has 365 days, the 100th day is April 10 (or April 11 in a leap year). Therefore, the number of days between these two dates is:\n\n(365 - 100) + 199 = 464\n\nNow, since 464 is not divisible by 7, we know that the 100th day of year N - 1 falls on a different day of the week than the 200th day of year N + 1. Specifically, if the 200th day of year N + 1 is a Tuesday, then the 100th day of year N - 1 is a Thursday.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 4.
