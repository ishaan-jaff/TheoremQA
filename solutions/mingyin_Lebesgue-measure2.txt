The reason behind answering "0" (no) to the question of whether set E is Lebesgue measurable is that the given condition violates one of the fundamental properties of Lebesgue measurability.

In Lebesgue measure theory, a set is considered Lebesgue measurable if it satisfies the property of inner and outer regularity. The given condition states that for any closed set F and open set G containing E, the measure of F is strictly less than the measure of G.

However, the property of inner regularity requires that for any set A, the measure of A should be equal to the supremum of measures of all closed sets contained in A. In this case, since the given condition guarantees that there exists a closed set F such that its measure is strictly less than the measure of G, it contradicts the inner regularity property.

Hence, due to this violation of inner regularity, the set E cannot be considered Lebesgue measurable, and the answer is "0" (no).
