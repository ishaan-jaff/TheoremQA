By definition, K_f consists of elements x in U_5 such that x^2 is equal to the identity element 1 in U_5.
We first find elements of U_5 to be [1, 2, 3, 4].
Then, we iterate through the elements to see which ones are in K_f.
x = 1, x^2 = 1 in U_5.
x = 2, x^2 = 4 != 1 in U_5
x = 3, x^2 = 4 != 1 in U_5
x = 4, x^2 = 1 in U_5.
Therefore, K_f = [1, 4].
