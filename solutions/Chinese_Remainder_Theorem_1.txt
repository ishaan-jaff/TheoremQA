According to Chinese Remainder Theorem, we firstly compute the partial products: N5 = 7*9 = 63, N7 = 5*9 = 45, N9 = 5*7 = 35. Then we calculate the modular inverses: i5*N5 == 1 (mod 5) ==> i5 = 2, i7*N7 == 1 (mod 7) ==> i7 = 5, i9*N9 == 1 (mod 9) ==> i9 = 8. Finally, we compute the solution x = r5*i5*N5 + r7*i7*N7 + r9*i9*N9 = 3*2*63 + 4*5*45 + 2*8*35 = 1838 = 263 (mod 5*7*9). Therefore, the answer is 263.
