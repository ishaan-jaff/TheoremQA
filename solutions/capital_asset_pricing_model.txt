To calculate the expected rate of return, we can use the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) formula:

Expected Rate of Return = Risk-Free Rate + Beta * (Market Return - Risk-Free Rate)

In this case, the risk-free rate is the yield on a UK 10-year treasury, which is 2.8%. The market return is given as 8.6%, and the Beta for the stock is 1.4.

Expected Rate of Return = 2.8% + 1.4 * (8.6% - 2.8%)

Expected Rate of Return = 2.8% + 1.4 * 5.8%

Expected Rate of Return = 2.8% + 8.12%

Expected Rate of Return = 10.92%

Therefore, the answer is 10.92.
