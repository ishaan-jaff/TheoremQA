To solve this problem, we can use combinations. Notice that balls are identical other than colors. We have three cases to consider: 1. We choose exactly 2 red balls and 2 other balls. 2. We choose exactly 3 red balls and 1 other ball. 3. We choose all 4 red balls. For case 1, we have 3 sub cases: (1) 2 red 2 green, (2) 2 red 1 green 1 blue, (3) 2 red 2 blue. Therefore, case 1 contains 3 combinations. For case 2, we have 2 sub cases: (1) 3 red 1 green, (2) 3 red 1 blue. Therefore, case 2 contains 2 combinations. For case 3, we only have 1 combination (all 4 red). As a result, there are totally 6 permutations.
