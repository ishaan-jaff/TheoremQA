This is because a complete graph with n vertices can be divided into two cliques of size 2 and 2, and the two cliques must share a common vertex. Therefore, if there is a 4-clique in red or blue, then the graph can be colored with red and blue. Thus, the smallest n that guarantees there is either a 4-clique in red or a 4-clique in blue is 4.</s><s>",

This can be derived by first noting that the capacity of a discrete memoryless channel is equal to the maximum of the mutual information between the input and output of the channel. Then, by considering the expression for mutual information between two random variables, we can see that the capacity of this channel is equal to the maximum of $I(X;Y)$ and $I(X;Z)$. Since $X$ and $Z$ are independent, it follows that $I(X;Z)=0$ and thus the capacity of the channel is equal to the maximum of $I(X;Y)$ which simplifies to 0.5 bits.</s><s>",

The answer needs to be in numerical form.\n\n### Input:\nFor an American perpetual option within the Black-Scholes framework, you are given: (i) $h_1 + h_2$ = 7/9 (ii) The continuously compounded risk-free interest rate is 5%. (iii) \u03c3 = 0.30.

How far in front of the rear axle is the car\u2019s center of gravity?\n\n### Response:\nThe car's center of gravity is located 1.43 m in front of the rear axle. To calculate this, we need to first calculate the weight of the car. We know that the weight of the car is equal to the sum of the normal forces on the front and rear wheels, so we can use the given percentage to calculate the weight of the car. We then use the distance between the axles and the percentage of weight on the front and rear wheels to calculate the distance from the center of gravity to the rear axle. Finally, we subtract this distance from the total distance between the axles to get the answer.</s><s>",

Dividing the file size by the throughput, roughly how many seconds will it take to transfer the file to Host B?\n\n### Response:\nWe can calculate the time taken to transfer the file to Host B by dividing the file size (4 million bytes) by the throughput of each link. Thus, for the first link (R1 = 500 kbps), it will take 8 seconds to transfer the file. For the second link (R2 = 2 Mbps), it will take 4 seconds to transfer the file. Finally, for the third link (R3 = Mbps), it will take 2 seconds to transfer the file. Therefore, it will take 18 seconds to transfer the file to Host B.</s><s>",

The bird flies from room to room going to adjoining rooms with equal probability through each of the walls. To be specific, the corner rooms have 3 exits. What is the entropy rate of this random walk? Use base 2 logarithm and return the entropy rate in bits.\n\n### Response:\nThe entropy rate of this random walk is 2 bits. To calculate this, we first need to calculate the number of possible states. There are 8 possible states in the maze, since the bird can be in any of the 8 rooms. Then, we need to calculate the probability of each state. The probability of the bird being in any of the corner rooms is 1/8, since there are 3 exits from each of these rooms. The probability of the bird being in any of the other rooms is 1/4, since there are 2 exits from each of these rooms. Finally, we use the formula H = - p * ln(q), where p is the probability of the bird being in a certain state and q is the number of possible states. In this case, p = 1/8 and q = 8, so H = - (1/8) * ln(8) = 2 bits.</s><s>",

Find the acceleration there due to gravity. (Unit: $m/s^2$)\n\n### Response:\nThe acceleration due to gravity on Mars is 3.76 m/s^2. This is calculated by first finding the force due to gravity, which is equal to the mass of Mars times its radius squared, divided by the square of its velocity. This gives us $F_M=m_M R_M^2/v_M^2$. Then, using Newton's second law, we can find the acceleration due to gravity, which is equal to the force divided by the earth's mass. This gives us $a_M=F_M/m_E$. Finally, substituting in the values for $F_M$ and $m_E$ gives us the acceleration due to gravity on Mars.</s><s>",

Your father-in-law (mass 95.0 kg) stands on a platform 45.0 m above the ground, and one end of the cord is tied securely to his ankle and the other end to the platform. You have promised him that when he steps off the platform he will fall a maximum distance of only 41.0 m before the cord stops him. You had several bungee cords to select from, and you tested them by stretching them out, tying one end to a tree, and pulling on the other end with a force of 380.0 N. When you do this, what distance (in m) will the bungee cord that you should select have stretched?\n\n### Response:\nThe bungee cord should be stretched 30.0 m. This is because the maximum distance the person will fall is 41.0 m, and the force of the bungee cord is 380.0 N. Therefore, the equation is F = kx, where F is the force of the bungee cord, k is the spring constant of the bungee cord, and x is the distance the bungee cord is stretched. Plugging in the numbers, we get F = kx, where F is 380.0 N, k is 30.0 N/m, and x is 41.0 m. Therefore, the bungee cord should be stretched 30.0 m.</s><s>",

What is the holding period return of his investment?\n\n### Response:\nWe can calculate the holding period return of Fred's investment by finding the rate of return on his investment. The rate of return is equal to the dividend income ($300) divided by the initial investment amount ($10,000). Therefore, the rate of return is 30%. We can then use the formula for holding period return to calculate the actual return. The formula is HPR = (Dividend Income + Capital Gain) / (Initial Investment Amount + Final Sale Price). Substituting in the numbers, we get HPR = (300 + 12000) / (10000 + 12000). Solving for HPR, we get HPR = 120%. Therefore, Fred's holding period return is 120%.</s><s>",

The tiles may be rotated and reflected, as long as their sides are parallel to the sides of the rectangular region. They must all fit within the region, and they must cover it completely without overlapping. What is the minimum number of tiles required to tile the region?\n\n### Response:\nWe can use the two types of tiles shown in the image to tile the region. The tiles must be rotated and reflected such that their sides are parallel to the sides of the rectangular region. We need to make sure that all the tiles fit within the region and cover it completely without overlapping. \n\nTo calculate the minimum number of tiles required, we first calculate the total area of the rectangular region. The area of the rectangular region is $21 \\times 17 = 3771$. Then, we calculate the area of each tile. The area of each tile is $1 \\times 1 = 1$. Therefore, the total area of all the tiles is $3771$. \n\nFinally, we divide the total area of all the tiles by the area of the rectangular region. The result is the minimum number of tiles required to tile the region. The minimum number of tiles required is 3771/3771 = 1. Therefore, 1 tile is the minimum number of tiles required to tile the region.</s><s>",

In 2015, Mr. Jackson decides to pay off the loan. Find the balance of the loan he still owes.\n\n### Response:\nWe can calculate the balance of the loan Mr. Jackson still owes by finding the amount he needs to pay off the loan in 2015.

To get this answer, we can use the algorithm for finding the decimal expansion of a fraction. First, divide the numerator (9) by the denominator (28) to get the quotient (3). Then, move the decimal point one place to the right, and the answer is the 1001th digit after the decimal point. Thus, the answer is 3.</s><s>",
