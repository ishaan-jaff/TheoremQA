    "rationale": "In a perfectly competitive market, the short-run equilibrium price is determined by the intersection of market demand and market supply. In this case, the market demand is given by Q = -200P + 8,000. To find the market supply, we need to sum up the individual firms' supply curves. Each firm's supply curve is given by its marginal cost curve, which can be obtained by taking the derivative of its short-run total cost function with respect to output (q). \n\nMC(q) = dC(q)/dq = q^2/100 + 0.4q + 4\n\nTo find the industry supply curve, we add up the individual firms' marginal cost curves:\n\nMC_industry(Q) = 100 * MC(q) = Q^2/30000 + 40Q + 400\n\nSetting MC_industry(Q) equal to market demand Q = -200P + 8,000, we get:\n\nQ^2/30000 + 40Q + 400 = -200P + 8,000\n\nSimplifying and rearranging, we get a quadratic equation in Q:\n\nQ^2 + 12000Q - 2,280,000 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we get:\n\nQ = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nwhere a = 1, b = 12000, and c = -2,280,000. Solving for Q, we get:\n\nQ = 1200 or Q = -19000\n\nSince Q represents quantity, we discard the negative root and conclude that the industry will supply 1200 units of output at the short-run equilibrium. To find the equilibrium price, we substitute Q = 1200 into the market demand equation:\n\n1200 = -200P + 8000\n\nSolving for P, we get:\n\nP = $34\n\nTherefore, the short-run equilibrium price in this perfectly competitive industry is $34.",

    "rationale": "In a Chord based DHT, each node is assigned an identifier based on a hash function. The identifier space is typically a circle with values ranging from 0 to 2^m-1, where m is the number of bits in the identifier. In this case, the address space is 25, which means m=25.\n\nTo find the target keys for node N3, we need to follow the Chord protocol. N3's successor is the smallest node ID that succeeds N3 in the identifier space. N3's finger table contains entries for the next nodes in the identifier space, so we can use that to find the successor.\n\nThe finger table for N3 would look like this:\n\n| i | successor |\n|---|-----------|\n| 0 | N8        |\n| 1 | N15       |\n| 2 | N19       |\n| 3 | N30       |\n| 4 | N8        |\n| 5 | N15       |\n| 6 | N19       |\n| 7 | N30       |\n| 8 | N8        |\n| 9 | N15       |\n|...|...        |\n\nTo find the successor of N3, we look at the first entry in the finger table, which is N8.

We can rearrange this formula to solve for the wavelength:\n\nlambda = hc/E\n\nSubstituting in the values we have:\n\nlambda = (6.626 x 10^-34 J*s)(3.00 x 10^8 m/s)/(3.36 eV)(1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV) = 3.70 x 10^-7 m\n\nFinally, we can use the formula for the intensity of light:\n\nI = P/A\n\nwhere P is the power of the light source and A is the area over which the light is spread. We know that the intensity required to eject a photoelectron is 10^-8 W/m^2. We can rearrange the formula to solve for the power:\n\nP = I*A = (10^-8 W/m^2)(4*pi*(1 m)^2) = 1.26 x 10^-6 W\n\nNow we can use the formula for the energy of a photon in terms of its power and time:\n\nE = P*t\n\nwhere t is the time for which the light shines. We can rearrange this formula to solve for the time:\n\nt = E/P = (3.36 eV)(1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV)/(1.26 x 10^-6 W) = 4.27 x 10^-13 s\n\nTherefore, the answer is 4.27 x 10^-13 seconds.",

    "question": "Consider a 900 Kbytes file stored in a web server. Client A sends a request to the server to retrieve the file from a remote location. There are 3 links (2 intermediate nodes) between server and client and each has a transmission rate of 10Mbps. Given that the segment size is 15 Kbytes, the round trip time (RTT) between the server and client is 30ms, the initial slow-start threshold is 8 and the client's buffer has a storage space of 150 K bytes. Assume that TCP Reno is used, there is no loss during transmission and the headers of protocols are ignored. It is noted that the segments do experience a store-and-forward delay in intermediate routers. Determine how many ms client A takes to receive the whole file from the server after sending a request.",
    "rationale": "First, we need to calculate the effective bandwidth between the server and the client. Since there are 2 intermediate nodes, the total bandwidth is the product of the bandwidths of the 3 links, which is 10 Mbps * 10 Mbps * 10 Mbps = 10 Gbps. However, we need to take into account the store-and-forward delay in the intermediate nodes. Each intermediate node will introduce a delay of 2 * RTT = 60 ms (since the segment size is 15 Kbytes and the transmission rate is 10 Mbps, it takes 12 ms to transmit each segment). Therefore, the effective bandwidth is:\n\nEffective bandwidth = Segment size / (RTT + Store-and-forward delay)\n                   = 15 Kbytes / (30 ms + 60 ms + 60 ms)\n                   = 100 Kbps\n\nNext, we need to calculate the congestion window (cwnd) at the start of the transmission. Since the initial slow-start threshold is 8 and the segment size is 15 Kbytes, the initial cwnd is:\n\ncwnd = Initial slow-start threshold * Segment size\n     = 8 * 15 Kbytes\n     = 120 Kbytes\n\nSince the client's buffer has a storage space of 150 Kbytes, the maximum cwnd that can be achieved without causing buffer overflow is 150 Kbytes. Therefore, the congestion window will increase from 120 Kbytes to 150 Kbytes during the slow-start phase.\n\nAfter the slow-start phase, the congestion window will increase according to the congestion avoidance algorithm of TCP Reno. Since there is no loss during transmission, the congestion window will increase linearly by 1 segment per RTT. Therefore, the time taken to transmit the whole file can be calculated as follows:\n\nTime taken = (File size + Slow-start phase + Congestion avoidance phase) / Effective bandwidth\n\nwhere File size = 900 Kbytes, Slow-start phase = 2 * RTT, and Congestion avoidance phase = (File size - Slow-start phase) / cwnd * RTT.\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\nTime taken = (900 Kbytes + 2 * 30 ms + (900 Kbytes - 2 * 30 ms) / 120 Kbytes * 30 ms) / 100 Kbps\n           = 9.6 s\n\nTherefore, the answer is 9600 ms.",

However, the temperature in the room is given as 20\u00b0C, which is not at STP. To find the density of air at 20\u00b0C, we can use the ideal gas law:\n\n$PV = nRT$\n\nwhere P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin. Solving for n/V, we get:\n\n$n/V = P/RT$\n\nAt 20\u00b0C, the pressure of air is approximately 101.3 kPa and the gas constant R is 8.31 J/(mol K). Converting the temperature to Kelvin, we get:\n\n$T = 20\u00b0C + 273.15 = 293.15 \\ K$\n\nSubstituting these values, we get:\n\n$n/V = (101.3 \\ kPa)/(8.31 \\ J/(mol \\ K) \\times 293.15 \\ K) = 0.0409 \\ mol/m^3$\n\nThe molar mass of air is approximately 28.97 g/mol.

There are 6 ways to choose the first person, 5 ways to choose the second person, and so on, down to 2 ways to choose the fifth person. The sixth person must sit at the first table since each table must have at least 1 person seated. Therefore, there are 6!/(5!1!) = 6 ways to choose the people who will sit at the first table.\n\nOnce the people for the first table are chosen, the remaining people will sit at the second table. There are 0 people left if all 6 people sit at the first table, 1 person left if 5 people sit at the first table, and so on, down to 4 people left if 1 person sits at the first table. For each of these cases, the number of ways to seat the remaining people at the second table is (n-1)!/(k-1)!, where n is the number of people left and k is the number of seats at the second table. Since the tables are identical, we need to divide by 2 to avoid overcounting.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to seat 6 people at 2 identical round tables is:\n\n6 * [(5!/(4!1!)) * (3!/(2!1!))/2 + (5!/(3!2!))/2 + (5!/(2!3!))/2 + (5!/(1!4!))/2] \n\n= 6 * [15/2 + 10/2 + 5/2 + 1/2] \n\n= 6 * 31/2 \n\n= 93\n\nTherefore, the answer is 93.",

    "rationale": "We can approach this problem using the Pr\u00fcfer sequence. Since we have 5 connected components, we can assign a unique label to each of them. Let's say the labels are A, B, C, D, and E. Then, we can create a Pr\u00fcfer sequence of length 3 using the labels A, B, C, D, and E, since we have 8 vertices and 5 of them are already assigned to different connected components. \n\nThe number of possible Pr\u00fcfer sequences of length 3 using 5 distinct labels is 5^3 = 125. For each Pr\u00fcfer sequence, we can construct a corresponding labelled forest as follows: \n\n1. Start with 8 isolated vertices. \n2. Find the smallest label in the Pr\u00fcfer sequence, say A. \n3. Find the vertex with the smallest label that is not in the connected component labelled A, say vertex v. \n4. Add an edge between vertex v and the vertex labelled A. \n5. Remove vertex v from the list of vertices and remove the label A from the Pr\u00fcfer sequence. \n6. Repeat steps 2-5 until there are only 3 vertices left. \n7. Add edges between the remaining 3 vertices according to the final Pr\u00fcfer sequence. \n\nNote that the number of labelled forests we obtain using this method depends only on the Pr\u00fcfer sequence, not on the specific choice of labels for the connected components. Therefore, the number of labelled forests on 8 vertices with 5 connected components, such that vertices 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 all belong to different connected components, is 125. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 125.",

We can use these values to find the cross-sectional area A2:\n\nA2 = \u03c0(d/2)^2 = \u03c0(0.02)^2 = 0.0012566 m^2\n\nWe also know the density of the oil \u03c1 = 850 kg/m^3. Since the oil is incompressible, its density is constant along the pipe.\n\nNow we can rearrange the equation of continuity to solve for v2:\n\nv2 = (A1/A2)v1\n\nWe can assume that the first section of the pipe has a larger diameter than the second section, so its cross-sectional area is larger. Let's say the diameter of the first section is d1. We can use the flow rate equation to find the cross-sectional area A1:\n\nA1 = Q/v1 = (\u03c0/4)d1^2v1\n\nSubstituting this into the equation of continuity and simplifying, we get:\n\nv2 = (d1/d2)^2v1\n\nWe don't know the value of d1, but we can use the fact that the pipe is cylindrical to relate it to the diameter of the second section:\n\nd1/d2 = \u221a(A2/A1) = \u221a(0.0012566/((\u03c0/4)d1^2))\n\nSolving for d1, we get:\n\nd1 = \u221a(4A2/\u03c0) = 0.0800 m\n\nTherefore, the diameter of the first section of the pipe is 8.00 cm.\n\nNow we can use the equation for v2:\n\nv2 = (d1/d2)^2v1 = (0.0800/0.0400)^2v1 = 4v1\n\nSubstituting the given flow rate, we get:\n\nv2 = 4Q/A2 = 4(0.0095)/(0.0012566) = 30.1 m/s\n\nTherefore, the flow speed in the second section of the pipe is 30.1 m/s.",

Therefore, the number of days between these two dates is:\n\n(365 - 100) + 199 = 464\n\nNow, since 464 is not divisible by 7, we know that the 100th day of year N - 1 falls on a different day of the week than the 200th day of year N + 1. Specifically, if the 200th day of year N + 1 is a Tuesday, then the 100th day of year N - 1 is a Thursday.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 4 (Thursday is the fourth day of the week).",

    "rationale": "We can use the formula for compound interest to find the final amount in the account after five years. The formula is:\n\nA = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)\n\nwhere A is the final amount, P is the principal (initial deposit), r is the annual interest rate (as a decimal), n is the number of times the interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years.\n\nIn this case, P = $500, r = 0.08 (8% as a decimal), n = 12 (compounded monthly), and t = 5. Plugging in these values, we get:\n\nA = 500(1 + 0.08/12)^(12*5)\nA = $33,864.79\n\nTherefore, the answer is $33,864.79.",

    "rationale": "No, the sequence (1,2,3,...) is not in the image of T. \n\nProof: Suppose (1,2,3,...) is in the image of T. Then there exists some sequence (a_0, a_1, a_2, ...) in V such that T(a_0, a_1, a_2, ...) = (1,2,3,...). This means that a_1 = 1, a_2 = 2, a_3 = 3, and so on. However, this implies that the sequence (a_0, 1, 2, 3, ...) is also in the image of T, since T(a_0, 1, 2, 3, ...) = (1, 2, 3, ...). But this contradicts the fact that T maps sequences to sequences with one fewer term. Therefore, the sequence (1,2,3,...) is not in the image of T. \n\nTherefore, the answer is False.",
