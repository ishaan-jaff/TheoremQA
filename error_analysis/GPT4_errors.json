    "question": "Two bicycle tires are set rolling with the same initial speed of 3.5 m/s on a long, straight road, and the distance each travels before its speed is reduced by half is measured. One tire is inflated to a pressure of 40 psi and goes 18.1 m; the other is at 105 psi and goes 92.9 m. What is the coefficient of rolling friction for each? Assume that the net horizontal force is due to rolling friction only.",
    "rationale": "To find the coefficient of rolling friction for each tire, we can use the formula for the work-energy principle:\n\nW = \u0394K.E\n\nwhere W is the work done by the rolling friction force, and \u0394K.E is the change in kinetic energy of the tire.\n\nThe work done by the rolling friction force can be expressed as:\n\nW = F_friction * d\n\nwhere F_friction is the rolling friction force and d is the distance traveled by the tire.\n\nThe change in kinetic energy can be expressed as:\n\n\u0394K.E = (1/2) * m * (v_final^2 - v_initial^2)\n\nwhere m is the mass of the tire, v_initial is the initial speed, and v_final is the final speed.\n\nSince the speed is reduced by half, v_final = 0.5 * v_initial.\n\nNow, we can express the rolling friction force as:\n\nF_friction = \u03bc * F_normal\n\nwhere \u03bc is the coefficient of rolling friction and F_normal is the normal force acting on the tire. Assuming the tire is on a horizontal surface, the normal force is equal to the gravitational force acting on the tire:\n\nF_normal = m * g\n\nwhere g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s^2).\n\nCombining all the equations, we get:\n\n\u03bc * m * g * d = (1/2) * m * (v_final^2 - v_initial^2)\n\nSince we are interested in finding \u03bc, we can rearrange the equation to solve for \u03bc:\n\n\u03bc = [(1/2) * (v_final^2 - v_initial^2)] / (g * d)\n\nFor the tire with 40 psi:\n\n\u03bc_40 = [(1/2) * (0.5 * 3.5^2 - 3.5^2)] / (9.81 * 18.1)\n\n\u03bc_40 \u2248 0.015\n\nFor the tire with 105 psi:\n\n\u03bc_105 = [(1/2) * (0.5 * 3.5^2 - 3.5^2)] / (9.81 * 92.9)\n\n\u03bc_105 \u2248 0.003\n\nTherefore, the answer is [0.015, 0.003].",

    "rationale": "To find the probability, we first need to determine the total number of integers in set S and the number of integers in S that are divisible by 9.\n\nSince the integers in S contain exactly two 1's when written in base 2, we can represent them as 2^x + 2^y, where x and y are distinct non-negative integers less than 40 (x \u2260 y, 0 \u2264 x, y < 40). There are 40 choices for x and 39 choices for y, but since the order of x and y doesn't matter, we have overcounted by a factor of 2. Therefore, the total number of integers in set S is (40 * 39) / 2 = 780.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of integers in S that are divisible by 9. Since 2^x + 2^y is divisible by 9, we have 2^x \u2261 -2^y (mod 9). We can rewrite this as 2^x \u2261 2^(y+3) (mod 9), since 2^3 \u2261 -1 (mod 9). \n\nWe can now create a table of powers of 2 modulo 9:\n\n2^0 \u2261 1 (mod 9)\n2^1 \u2261 2 (mod 9)\n2^2 \u2261 4 (mod 9)\n2^3 \u2261 8 \u2261 -1 (mod 9)\n2^4 \u2261 7 (mod 9)\n2^5 \u2261 5 (mod 9)\n2^6 \u2261 1 (mod 9)\n\nThe powers of 2 modulo 9 repeat with a period of 6.

Each of these pairs corresponds to a unique solution modulo 6, and since 40 is a multiple of 6, each pair corresponds to exactly one solution in the range 0 \u2264 x, y < 40.\n\nThus, there are 6 integers in S that are divisible by 9. The probability that a random integer from S is divisible by 9 is 6/780, which simplifies to 1/130.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1/130.",

Since we choose a white square uniformly at random, the probability of choosing a specific white square is $1/N$. If a white square has $k$ white neighbors, the probability of choosing one of its white neighbors is $k/N$.

They must all fit within the region, and they must cover it completely without overlapping. What is the minimum number of tiles required to tile the region?",
    "rationale": "To find the minimum number of tiles required to tile the 21x17 rectangular region, we need to analyze the two types of tiles. Let's call the first type of tile (with 4 squares) a \"square tile\" and the second type of tile (with 6 squares) a \"hexagonal tile.\"\n\nFirst, let's consider the total area of the rectangular region: 21 * 17 = 357 square units.\n\nNow, let's consider the area of each type of tile:\n- Square tile: 4 square units\n- Hexagonal tile: 6 square units\n\nWe want to minimize the number of tiles used, so we should try to use as many hexagonal tiles as possible. However, since the total area of the rectangular region is an odd number (357), we cannot cover the entire region using only hexagonal tiles (as their area is even). Therefore, we must use at least one square tile.\n\nNow, let's subtract the area of one square tile from the total area: 357 - 4 = 353 square units. Since 353 is divisible by 6, we can cover the remaining area using hexagonal tiles.\n\nTo find the minimum number of hexagonal tiles needed, we can divide the remaining area by the area of a hexagonal tile: 353 / 6 \u2248 58.83. Since we cannot use a fraction of a tile, we need to round up to the nearest whole number, which is 59.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1 (square tile) + 59 (hexagonal tiles) = 60 tiles.",

To achieve 3-digit accuracy, we need to divide this range into increments of 0.001 years (since 3-digit accuracy means accuracy up to the thousandths place).\n\nThe number of increments in this range is:\n\n(160 - 0) / 0.001 = 160,000\n\nNow, we need to determine how many bits are required to represent these 160,000 possible values.

    "question": "Each day Paul, who is in third grade, eats lunch at school. He likes only Twinkies (t) and soda (s), and these provide him a utility of utility = U(t,s) = \\sqrt{ts}. If Twinkies cost $0.10 each and soda costs $0.25 per cup, Paul's mom gives him $1, how many Twinkies should Paul buy to maximize utility?",
    "rationale": "To maximize utility, we need to find the optimal combination of Twinkies (t) and soda (s) that Paul can buy with his $1 budget. Let's set up the budget constraint equation:\n\n0.10t + 0.25s = 1\n\nNow, we need to solve for either t or s to substitute into the utility function. Let's solve for s:\n\ns = (1 - 0.10t) / 0.25\n\nNow, substitute this expression for s into the utility function:\n\nU(t, s) = \u221a(t * ((1 - 0.10t) / 0.25))\n\nTo maximize utility, we need to find the maximum value of this function. To do this, we can take the first derivative of the utility function with respect to t and set it equal to 0:\n\ndU(t)/dt = (1/2) * (t * ((1 - 0.10t) / 0.25))^(-1/2) * (1/0.25 - 0.20t)\n\nSetting the derivative equal to 0 and solving for t:\n\n0 = (1/2) * (t * ((1 - 0.10t) / 0.25))^(-1/2) * (1/0.25 - 0.20t)\n\nSince the term (t * ((1 - 0.10t) / 0.25))^(-1/2) cannot be 0, we can ignore it and focus on the remaining part of the equation:\n\n0 = (1/0.25 - 0.20t)\n\nSolving for t:\n\nt = (1/0.25) / 0.20 = 5/2 = 2.5\n\nSince Paul can only buy whole Twinkies, he should buy either 2 or 3 Twinkies. We need to compare the utility of buying 2 Twinkies and 3 Twinkies to determine which option maximizes utility.\n\nIf Paul buys 2 Twinkies, he spends $0.20 on Twinkies, leaving $0.80 for soda. He can buy 3.2 cups of soda (0.80 / 0.25). The utility of this combination is:\n\nU(2, 3.2) = \u221a(2 * 3.2) = \u221a6.4 \u2248 2.53\n\nIf Paul buys 3 Twinkies, he spends $0.30 on Twinkies, leaving $0.70 for soda. He can buy 2.8 cups of soda (0.70 / 0.25). The utility of this combination is:\n\nU(3, 2.8) = \u221a(3 * 2.8) = \u221a8.4 \u2248 2.90\n\nSince the utility of buying 3 Twinkies is higher than the utility of buying 2 Twinkies, Paul should buy 3 Twinkies to maximize utility.

Since both subsets must be non-empty, k can range from 1 to 4.
