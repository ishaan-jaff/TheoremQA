Since there are 8,000 hours in a year, the person's working income will be 8,000 * $5 = $40,000. Full income of this person will also need to account for the received heritage of $4,000 a year, making the full income $44,000. Devoting 75% of full income to leisure meaning devoting $44,000 * 75% = $33,000 to leisure. This means that the person will only have to earn $40,000 - $33,000 = $7,000 from working. Number of working hour in this case is then $7,000 / $5 = 1,400 hours.
