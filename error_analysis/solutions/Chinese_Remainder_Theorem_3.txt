According to Chinese Remainder Theorem, we firstly compute the partial products: N8 = 3*11 = 33, N3 = 8*11 = 88, N11 = 8*3 = 24. Then we calculate the modular inverses: i8*N8 == 1 (mod 8) ==> i8 = 1, i3*N3 == 1 (mod 3) ==> i3 = 1, i11*N11 == 1 (mod 11) ==> i11 = 6. Finally, we compute the solution x = r8*i8*N8 + r3*i3*N3 + r11*i11*N11 = 5*1*33 + 1*1*88 + 7*6*24 = 1261 = 205 (mod 8*3*11). Therefore, the answer is 205.
