Let us group those integers by their remainders mod 10. Denote the number of integers whose remainders are i (mod 10) as n_i. On the one hand, we know that $\sum_{i=0}^9 n_i = 20$. On the other hand, the total number of pairs whose difference can be divided by 10 is $\sum_{i=0}^9 (n_i \choose 2) = \sum_{i=0}^9 \frac{n_i(n_i-1)}2 = \frac12\sum_{i=0}^9n_i^2 - \frac12\sum_{i=0}^9n_i = \frac12\sum_{i=0}^9n_i^2-10$. According to Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, we have $\sum_{i=0}^9n_i^2\geq\frac{(\sum_{i=0}^9n_i)^2}{10}=\frac{20^2}{10}=40$. As a result, we have $\sum_{i=0}^9 (n_i \choose 2)\geq\frac12\cdot40-10=10$. The answer is 10.
