To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum coefficient of static friction (μ) needed to prevent skidding. We can use the following formula:

μ = (v^2 / r - g * tanθ) / (g + v^2 * tanθ / r)

where v is the speed of the automobile, r is the radius of the curve, g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s^2), and θ is the angle of the banked curve.

First, we need to find the angle θ. We can use the formula for the correct banking angle:

tanθ = v_c^2 / (r * g)

where v_c is the correct speed for the banked curve (20 m/s). Plugging in the values, we get:

tanθ = (20 m/s)^2 / (120 m * 9.81 m/s^2)
tanθ ≈ 0.34

Now, we can find the minimum coefficient of static friction (μ) using the formula mentioned earlier:

μ = ((30 m/s)^2 / (120 m) - 9.81 m/s^2 * 0.34) / (9.81 m/s^2 + (30 m/s)^2 * 0.34 / (120 m))
μ ≈ 0.34

Therefore, the answer is 0.34.
