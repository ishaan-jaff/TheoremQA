First calculate the profit-maximizing price and quantity for this monopolist. The marginal revenue curve has the same intercept as the inverse demand curve and twice the slope: MR = 53 - 2Q. Marginal cost is a constant $5. Setting MR = MC, The optimal quantity and optimal price is Q=24 and P=29. Underperfect competition, P=MC=5, Q=53-P=48. Therefore, the consumer surplus in this case is equal to (53 - 29) * 48 = 1152.
