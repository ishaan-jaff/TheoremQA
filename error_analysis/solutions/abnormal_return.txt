To calculate the abnormal return, we first need to find the expected return using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) formula:

Expected Return = Rf + Beta * (Rm - Rf)

Where Rf is the risk-free rate, Rm is the market return, and Beta is the beta of the portfolio.

Expected Return = 0.04 + 1.8 * (0.12 - 0.04)
Expected Return = 0.04 + 1.8 * 0.08
Expected Return = 0.04 + 0.144
Expected Return = 0.184

Now, we need to find the actual return of the portfolio:

Actual Return = (Ending Value - Beginning Value) / Beginning Value
Actual Return = ($60,000 - $50,000) / $50,000
Actual Return = $10,000 / $50,000
Actual Return = 0.2

Finally, we can calculate the abnormal return:

Abnormal Return = Actual Return - Expected Return
Abnormal Return = 0.2 - 0.184
Abnormal Return = 0.016

Therefore, the answer is 0.016.
