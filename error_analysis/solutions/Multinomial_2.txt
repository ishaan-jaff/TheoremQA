To split the group of 9 people into 3 committees of 3 people, we can use the multinomial coefficient formula. Since the committees are identical besides of members, we have to divide the multinomial coefficient by the permutation number of committees. Therefore, the formula is: (Number of people)! / ((Size of committee 1)! * (Size of committee 2)! * (Size of committee 3)!*(Number of committees)!) In this case, we have: 9! / (3! * 3! * 3! * 3!). Calculating the factorials, we get: 362880 / (6 * 6 * 6 * 6) Which simplifies to: 362880 / 1296. The result is: 280.
