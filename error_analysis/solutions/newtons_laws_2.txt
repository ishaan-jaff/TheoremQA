To find the coefficient of rolling friction for each tire, we can use the formula for the work-energy principle:

W = ΔK.E

where W is the work done by the rolling friction force, and ΔK.E is the change in kinetic energy of the tire.

The work done by the rolling friction force can be expressed as:

W = - F_friction * d

where F_friction is the rolling friction force and d is the distance traveled by the tire.

The change in kinetic energy can be expressed as:

ΔK.E = (1/2) * m * (v_final^2 - v_initial^2)

where m is the mass of the tire, v_initial is the initial speed, and v_final is the final speed.

Since the speed is reduced by half, v_final = 0.5 * v_initial.

Now, we can express the rolling friction force as:

F_friction = μ * F_normal

where μ is the coefficient of rolling friction and F_normal is the normal force acting on the tire. Assuming the tire is on a horizontal surface, the normal force is equal to the gravitational force acting on the tire:

F_normal = m * g

where g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s^2).

Combining all the equations, we get:

- μ * m * g * d = (1/2) * m * (v_final^2 - v_initial^2)

Since we are interested in finding μ, we can rearrange the equation to solve for μ:

μ = [(1/2) * (v_initial^2- v_final^2)] / (g * d)

For the tire with 40 psi:

μ_40 = [(1/2) * (3.5^2 - (0.5 * 3.5)^2)] / (9.81 * 18.1)

μ_40 ≈ 0.0259

For the tire with 105 psi:

μ_105 = [(1/2) * (3.5^2 - (0.5 * 3.5)^2)] / (9.81 * 92.9)

μ_105 ≈ 0.00505

Therefore, the answer is [0.0259, 0.00505].
