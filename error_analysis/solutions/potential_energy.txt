To solve this problem, we need to find the spring constant k and then use it to find the distance the bungee cord should stretch when pulled with a force of 380.0 N.

First, let's find the spring constant k. When your father-in-law reaches the maximum distance of 41.0 m, the potential energy (PE) he gained will be equal to the elastic potential energy (EPE) stored in the bungee cord. The equation for potential energy is:

PE = m * g * h

where m is the mass (95.0 kg), g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s²), and h is the height fallen (41.0 m). Note that we take the height as negative since he is falling.

PE = 95.0 kg * 9.81 m/s² * (-41.0 m) = -38209.95 J

Now, let's find the elastic potential energy (EPE) stored in the bungee cord. The equation for elastic potential energy is:

EPE = (1/2) * k * x²

where k is the spring constant and x is the distance the bungee cord is stretched (41.0 - 30.0 = 11.0 m). Since the potential energy is equal to the elastic potential energy, we can set the two equations equal to each other:

-38209.95 J = (1/2) * k * (11.0 m)²

Solving for k, we get:

k = (-38209.95 J) / (1/2 * (11.0 m)²) = 631.569421 N/m

Now that we have the spring constant k, we can find the distance the bungee cord should stretch when pulled with a force of 380.0 N. Using Hooke's Law, we have:

F = k * x

where F is the force (380.0 N) and x is the distance the bungee cord should stretch. Solving for x, we get:

x = F / k = 380.0 N / 631.569421 N/m = 0.602 m

Therefore, the answer is 0.602.
