Solving this question requires knowledge on profit calculation and profit maximization. First, we can derive the profit calculation equation from the information provided, which is (total profit = total income - total cost). Let q = the number of acres John chooses to cut a day, we can have that (total profit = 20q - (0.1q^2 + 10q + 50) = -(0.1q^2 - 10q + 50)). Therefore, in order to maximize profit, we want to calculate the maximum of the profit calculation equation. A maximum is reached when the first derivative of the function is zero: -(0.2q - 10) = 0. Therefore, we can have that the profit reaches maximum when q = 50. Second, we calculate the maximum daily profit, which is the profit at q = 50. Maximum total profit is then equal to -(0.1*50^2 - 10*50 + 50) = 500 - 250 - 50 = 200.
