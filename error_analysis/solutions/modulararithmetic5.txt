The sum of the first three numbers is divisible by 3. The sum of the first four numbers is divisible by 4. If we write out all 5 numbers in mod 3, we get 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, respectively. Clearly the only way to get a number divisible by 3 by adding three of these is 1 + 1 + 1, so those scores must be entered first. Now we have an odd sum, so we must add 71 in order for the sum to be divisible by 4. That leaves 80 for the last score entered.
