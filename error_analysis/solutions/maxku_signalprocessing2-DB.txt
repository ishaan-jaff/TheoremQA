Is 80 dB twice as loud as 40 dB?

No.

Sound level in dB is a physical quantity and may be measured objectively.
Loudness is a perceived quantity and one can only obtain measurements of it by asking people questions about loudness or relative loudness. (Different people have different answers)

Relating the two is called psychophysics. Psychophysics experiments show that subjects report a doubling of loudness for each increase in sound level of approximately 10dB.
(So roughly speaking, 50dB is twice as loud as 40dB, 60 dB is twice as loud as 50dB, etc.)

Since 80dB is 40dB more than 40dB, 80dB is roughly 2x2x2x2 = 16 times as loud as 40 dB.
