Actions that would take the agent off the grid leave its location unchanged, but also result in a reward of $-1$. Other actions result in a reward of $0$, except those move the agent out of the special states A and B. From state A, all four actions yield a reward of +10 and take the agent to A'. From state B, all actions yield a reward of +5 and take the agent to B'. Suppose the discount gamma=0.9. The state-value function of a policy $\\pi$ is defined as the expected cumulative reward of $\\pi$ given the current state.

    "Question": "A perceptual audio codec is used to compress an audio signal. The codec groups every 4 barks into a subband and then allocates bits to different subbands according to the result of a spectrum analysis based on a psychoacoustic model. All samples in the same subband are quantized with the same quantizer, and the bit resolution of which is allocated by the codec. (The Bark scale is a psychoacoustical scale proposed by Eberhard Zwicker in 1961.) Fig. Q1a shows the frequency spectrum of a windowed segment of audio signal. The psychoacoustic model shown in Fig. Q1b is used in the audio codec to derive the masking threshold for the audio segment. How many potential maskers in Fig. Q1a?",
